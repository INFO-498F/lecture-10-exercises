This is the code we'll look at in class.  This is just plain old Markdown that let's you render text in **bold** or _italics_.  However, we can put in a chunk or R code, and it will show us the code and results!

```{r, echo=FALSE}
x <- runif(1:100)
hist(x)
```

(It didn't show the **code**)

# Markdown text
I wrote some markdown text, then did some analysis:
```{r}
scores <- runif(100, 50, 100)
avg <- mean(scores)
```
Then I wanted to tell you that the average was `r avg` across `r length(scores)` tests.
