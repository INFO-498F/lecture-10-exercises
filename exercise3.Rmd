```{r, echo=FALSE}

# Please use your own key!
api_key <- 'Y0SBZBEY1KHGBJKVR'

# Store the name of your band in a variable
band <- 'Chris Thile'

# Creat another variable that replaces your spaces with +'s (hint: gsub)
band_no_spaces <- gsub(' ', '+', band)

# Write a query to get the first biography of your band on echonest

# Run another query to get band images: see: http://developer.echonest.com/docs/v4/artist.html#images
### Warning: you may get an error message if the image is not available -- check online that it exists!

# Outside of this code section, write the (R)Markdown syntax that:
# - States the name of your band
# - Displays the bio you just retrieved 
# - Shows the image of your band

### Bonus ###
# Make another request, and retrieve/display the band's top songs
# Wrap the above steps in a function that takes a band as a parameter, and returns the desired info
```

Here's a bio I found on `r band`:

>`r bio$response$biographies$text`

And here's a great photo!
